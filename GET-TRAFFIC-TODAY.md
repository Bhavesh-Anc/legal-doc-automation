## 🚀 Quick Wins (Do These First - 30 Minutes)

### 1. Reddit Posts (Highest ROI - Do This FIRST)

**Post #1: r/Divorce (62k members)**
- **Subreddit**: r/Divorce
- **Post Type**: Value-First Help Post
- **Title**: "I built a free tool to auto-generate California divorce forms after seeing how expensive lawyers are"
- **Content**:
```
I went through a divorce 2 years ago in California and was shocked by the cost - $3,500 just for document prep from my attorney.

So I built a free tool that uses AI to generate court-ready divorce documents (FL-100 Petition, custody agreements, property settlement, child support, spousal support).

It's 100% free, no credit card, takes about 15 minutes. Built specifically for California family law.

I'm sharing it here in case it helps anyone going through this: [your-url]

Not trying to sell anything - just thought it might help some folks save money during an already tough time.

Happy to answer questions if you have any!

**Post #2: r/legaladvice (2.6M members)**
- **Subreddit**: r/legaladvice
- **Title**: "[CA] Are AI-generated legal documents valid for filing in California courts?"
- **Content**:
```
I'm in California going through a divorce. I found a tool that generates divorce forms using AI (FL-100, custody agreements, etc.).

My question: Are documents generated by AI legally valid to file in California family courts? Or do they HAVE to be prepared by an attorney?

For context, the tool generates the forms based on information I provide. I would still review everything before filing.

Trying to avoid the $3,000+ cost of having an attorney prepare documents if I can do it myself.

Any family law attorneys here who can advise?

[In comments, you can mention your tool after someone asks]

**Post #3: r/California (500k members)**
- **Subreddit**: r/California
- **Title**: "Built a free tool to help Californians generate family law documents - feedback welcome"
- **Content**:
```
Hey California! I built something I wish existed when I went through my divorce.

It's a free tool that auto-generates California family law documents:
- Divorce petitions (FL-100)
- Child custody agreements
- Property settlement agreements
- Child support orders
- Spousal support orders

100% free, no signup required (unless you want to save your work), takes ~15 minutes.

Built it because attorneys charge $3,000-5,000 just for document prep, which is insane.

Would love feedback from anyone in family law or who's been through this process: [your-url]

Not trying to spam - genuinely want to help Californians save money on legal fees.

**Post #4: r/personalfinance (18M members)**
- **Subreddit**: r/personalfinance
- **Title**: "PSA: You can save $3,000-5,000 on divorce by generating your own legal documents"
- **Content**:
```
Going through a divorce is expensive enough. Don't pay thousands just for document preparation.

In California (and many other states), you can file your own divorce paperwork. The forms are public - you just need to fill them out correctly.

I built a free tool after my own divorce to help with this: [your-url]

It generates court-ready documents in 15 minutes for:
- Divorce petitions
- Custody agreements
- Property settlement
- Child/spousal support

Saved me $3,500. Might help someone else.

Obviously still consult an attorney for complex cases, but for simple uncontested divorces, this can save a ton of money.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Getting Traffic

### 1. **Lead with Value, Not Your Product**
❌ "Check out my tool!"
✅ "Here's how I saved $3,500 on my divorce..."

### 2. **Tell Your Story**
People connect with stories, not features:
- Why did you build this?
- What problem were you solving?
- How did it help you?

### 3. **Engage in Comments**
Don't just post and disappear:
- Answer every question
- Thank people for feedback
- Be genuinely helpful
- Mention your tool when relevant

### 4. **Track What Works**
Use PostHog (once you set it up) to see:
- Which Reddit posts drive traffic
- Which pages users visit
- Where they drop off
- Which templates they use

### 5. **Be Patient but Persistent**
- Day 1: 50-100 visitors is GREAT
- Week 1: Aim for 500-1,000 visitors
- Month 1: Aim for 5,000-10,000 visitors

Growth is slow at first, then compounds.

## 📝 Reddit Post Templates

Here are copy-paste templates for quick posting:

### Template 1: Personal Story (r/Divorce)
```
Title: Saved $3,500 on divorce by generating my own legal documents - sharing what I learned

I'm 6 months post-divorce and wanted to share something that saved me a ton of money.

My attorney quoted $3,500 just for document preparation (petition, custody agreement, property settlement, etc.). Not for representation - just filling out forms.

I found out these forms are public and you can file them yourself in California. So I built a free tool to auto-generate them: [your-url]

It takes about 15 minutes and generates court-ready documents. I filed everything myself and saved thousands.

Obviously get an attorney for contested divorces or complex cases, but for simple uncontested divorces, this can help.

Just thought I'd share in case it helps someone else going through this.
```

### Template 2: Question Format (r/legaladvice)
```
Title: [CA] Can I file my own divorce paperwork or do I need an attorney?

Location: California

My spouse and I have agreed to divorce. We have a separation agreement worked out. No kids, minimal assets.

Question: Can I file the divorce paperwork myself? Or do I legally need an attorney?

Attorneys I've contacted want $3,000-5,000 just for document prep. Seems excessive for a simple case.

I found some tools online that generate the forms (like [your-url]). Is it legal to use AI-generated documents?

Any family law attorneys who can advise?

Thanks!
```

### Template 3: Resource Share (r/California)
```
Title: Free resource for Californians going through divorce - looking for feedback

Built a tool to help with California divorce paperwork after my own experience.

It auto-generates:
✅ FL-100 Divorce Petition
✅ Custody agreements
✅ Property settlement
✅ Child support orders
✅ Spousal support orders

Completely free, no signup required, takes ~15 mins.

Link: [your-url]

Looking for feedback from anyone who's been through the CA divorce process. What would make this more helpful?

Not here to spam - genuinely want to improve this for people going through a tough time.
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't:
❌ Post the same link to 10 subreddits in 10 minutes (looks like spam)
❌ Ignore negative feedback (respond professionally)
❌ Only promote, never engage (be part of the community)
❌ Use clickbait titles (be honest and helpful)
❌ Give up after day 1 (traffic takes time to build)

### Do:
✅ Space out posts over 2-3 days
✅ Respond to every comment
✅ Be helpful first, promotional second
✅ Track what works (Reddit post → traffic → signups)
✅ Keep posting consistently for 30 days
