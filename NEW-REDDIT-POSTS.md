### Title:
Built a free AI tool to generate California family law forms - would love feedback

### Post:

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a free tool that automates California family law document generation, and I just added 2 new forms today. Would love your feedback!

**What it does:**
- Generates court-ready legal documents using AI
- 7 California family law forms (divorce, custody, child support, name change, etc.)
- 100% free, no credit card required
- Auto-saves progress, validates input, generates professional PDFs

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript + Zod validation
- Supabase (auth + database)
- React Hook Form
- AI document generation

**Why I built this:**
Legal forms cost $200-500 per document. Many people going through divorce can't afford an attorney. I wanted to make court-ready forms accessible to everyone for free.

**What I'm working on:**
- Just launched FL-395 (Name Change After Divorce) and FL-350 (Child Support Stipulation)
- Adding 15+ more California forms
- Expanding to other states (Texas, Florida, NY)
- Building a community resource hub

**What I need help with:**
1. Is the form flow intuitive? Any UX suggestions?
2. What legal forms do you think would be most helpful?
3. How can I reach people who actually need this?

Happy to answer questions about the build process or tech choices! This has been a really fulfilling side project.

## Post 2: r/InternetIsBeautiful

**Flair**: Auto-assigned based on content

### Title:
Free AI-powered California legal document generator - creates court-ready forms in minutes

### Post:

I found this free tool that generates California family law documents using AI. Pretty useful if you're going through divorce/custody and can't afford a lawyer.

**What makes it cool:**
- Ask questions in plain English (no legal jargon)
- AI converts your answers into proper court forms
- Auto-saves progress, validates everything
- Generates professional PDFs ready to file
- Completely free (normally $200-500 per form)

**Available forms:**
- Divorce Petition (FL-100)
- Child Custody Agreement
- Child Support Orders
- Name Change After Divorce (FL-395)
- Spousal Support
- Property Settlement
- And more...

**How it works:**
1. Pick the form you need
2. Answer questions about your case
3. AI generates the document
4. Download and file with court

The interface is really clean and the tooltips explain what each legal term means. Saves you from hiring a paralegal just to fill out forms.

Note: This generates the documents, but you still need to file them with the court yourself. Not a replacement for legal advice, but super helpful for the paperwork part.

## Post 3: r/startups

**Subreddit**: r/startups (1.4M+ members)
**Rules**: ✅ Must be startup-related, provide value
**Best Time**: Tuesday/Wednesday, 9am-12pm PST
**Flair**: "Marketing & Growth" or "Show & Tell"

### Title:
Launched my LegalTech MVP: Free AI document generator for family law (7 forms live, seeking feedback)

### Post:

**TL;DR:** Built a free AI-powered legal document generator for California family law. 7 forms live, 100% free, no paywall. Looking for feedback on go-to-market strategy.

---

## Background

I launched a free legal document automation platform targeting California family law cases (divorce, custody, child support). The problem: Legal documents cost $200-500 each, and many people going through divorce can't afford attorneys.

**Live:** https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app

---

## Current Status

**Launched:** January 2025
**Forms:** 7 California family law documents
**Users:** Early stage (just deployed 2 new forms today)
**Revenue:** $0 (100% free for now)

**Tech:**
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase
- AI document generation
- Form validation + auto-save
- User analytics with PostHog

---

## What Works

✅ Users complete forms in 10-15 minutes (vs 2-3 hours with paper forms)
✅ AI generates court-ready documents that match official formats
✅ No signup required to fill forms (reduces friction)
✅ Auto-save prevents lost progress
✅ Built-in tooltips explain legal terms

---

## Challenges

1. **Distribution:** How do I reach people who need this?
   - They're not on Twitter/Reddit actively
   - Most are stressed, emotional, dealing with divorce
   - Not actively searching for "AI legal tools"

2. **Trust:** Legal documents are high-stakes
   - People worry about mistakes
   - How do I build credibility without being a law firm?

3. **Monetization:** Should it stay free?
   - Could charge $20-50 per document (still 80% cheaper than lawyers)
   - Or keep free and monetize with premium templates/consultations?
   - Free helps more people, but need to sustain development

---

## Questions for r/startups

1. **Go-to-market:** Where do people actually search for legal help?
   - Google Ads on "California divorce forms"?
   - Facebook groups for divorced parents?
   - Partnership with family law attorneys?

2. **Freemium vs Free:** Should I keep it 100% free or introduce paid tiers?
   - Free tier: 7 basic forms
   - Paid tier: Advanced forms, lawyer review, expedited support?

3. **Expanding:** Add more states or go deeper in California first?
   - 15+ more CA forms planned (FL-300, FL-150, DV restraining orders)
   - TX/FL/NY have different forms/rules
   - Better to be the best in one state first?

4. **Trust building:** How do you build credibility in legal tech?
   - Partner with attorneys for review?
   - Get testimonials from actual users?
   - Legal disclaimers enough?

---

## Roadmap

**Next 30 days:**
- Add FL-300 Request for Order (most requested)
- Implement user feedback system
- Add more California counties
- Build email reminder system for court deadlines

**Next 90 days:**
- 15+ California forms
- Attorney review service (paid)
- Expand to Texas
- SEO optimization

---

## What I'd love feedback on

- Does freemium make sense here or should it stay 100% free?
- What's the best way to reach people going through divorce?
- Should I partner with family law attorneys or compete with them?
- Any LegalTech founders here with advice?

Happy to answer questions about the build, tech stack, or legal challenges!

**P.S.** - If you know anyone going through a California divorce/custody case, feel free to share. It's free and might help them save $500-1000 on form prep.

## Response Templates

### If asked "Is this legal advice?"
"No, this tool helps you fill out forms, but it's not legal advice. For complex cases or legal strategy, you should consult an attorney. This just makes the paperwork easier."

### If asked "How do you make money?"
"Right now it's 100% free. I'm exploring paid add-ons like attorney review or advanced forms, but basic forms will always be free."

### If asked "Why California only?"
"Started with California because it's the biggest market and has standardized forms. Planning to expand to Texas and Florida next based on demand."

### If someone shares a problem
"That's a great point - would you mind if I DM you to learn more about your specific situation? I'm trying to understand what users actually need."
