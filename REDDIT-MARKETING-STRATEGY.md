## 📊 Reddit Subreddits to Target

### Tier 1: High-Value, Direct Audience (Post Here FIRST)

#### 1. r/Divorce (750k+ members) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why**: People actively going through divorce, need legal docs
**Rules**: Must provide value, no self-promotion in titles
**Best time**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm PT
**Post frequency**: Once per week

**Post Template**:
```
Title: I created a free tool to generate California divorce/custody documents (saved me $3,000)

Body:
Going through my divorce last year, I was quoted $5,000 just for basic paperwork. As a developer, I decided to build a tool that generates court-ready legal documents for free.

It currently handles:
- Divorce petitions (FL-100)
- Custody agreements
- Property settlement
- Child/spousal support orders

The tool uses AI to fill in California Judicial Council forms based on your information. Everything is 100% free, no credit card required.

I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice - but it's the same paperwork attorneys would file. You still need to review everything and potentially consult an attorney before filing.

If you're in California and need help with divorce/custody paperwork, hope this helps: [YOUR_URL]

Happy to answer questions about how it works!
```

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to EVERY comment within 1 hour

Title: Free custody agreement generator I built (California)

Body:
After spending $4,000 on attorney fees for a basic custody agreement, I built a free tool that generates court-ready custody documents for California.

It walks you through:
- Legal vs. physical custody
- Parenting time schedules
- Holiday schedules
- Exchange locations
- Decision-making authority

Takes about 15-20 minutes and generates a proper California Family Law document you can file with the court.

100% free, no strings attached. I'm just a parent who went through this and wanted to help others.

Not legal advice - always review with an attorney before filing. But this saves thousands in document prep fees.

Questions welcome!
```

---

#### 3. r/legaladvice (2.5M+ members) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why**: Huge audience, people seeking legal help
**Rules**: STRICT - must genuinely ask for/offer advice, no ads
**Best approach**: Answer questions, mention tool subtly

**Post Template** (Must be a genuine question):
```
Title: [CA] Filed my own divorce paperwork - what attorneys actually do vs. what you can DIY?

Body:
I recently filed for divorce in California and handled all the paperwork myself using a document generation tool I built. Total cost: $435 filing fee vs. the $5,000 my attorney quoted.

For those considering DIY divorce in California:

What attorneys DO that's valuable:
- Legal strategy and advice
- Negotiation with other party
- Court representation
- Complex property division
- Contested custody battles

What's often just paperwork (you can DIY):
- Filling out FL-100 (Petition)
- Basic custody agreements
- Uncontested property settlement
- Child support calculations (state has formulas)

Obviously not legal advice, but for simple, uncontested cases, you might not need to pay $5k just for document prep.

Anyone else gone the DIY route? What was your experience?
```

**Strategy**: Share in comments when relevant, don't make standalone promotional posts

---

#### 4. r/personalfinance (18M+ members) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why**: People looking to save money, appreciate cost-saving tools
**Rules**: Must be financial advice-focused

**Post Template**:
```
Title: Saved $4,500 on divorce paperwork costs - here's how

Body:
Divorce is expensive enough without paying attorneys $5,000+ just for paperwork.

My attorney quoted:
- $2,500 retainer
- $350/hour
- Estimated 15-20 hours for "simple" uncontested divorce
- Total: $5,000-$7,000

What I did instead:
- Used a document generation tool (I built it)
- Spent 2 hours filling out forms
- Reviewed with a $300 legal consultation
- Filed myself
- Total cost: $435 (filing fee) + $300 (consultation) = $735

Savings: $4,500+

This works for:
- Uncontested divorce
- Simple custody agreements
- No complex assets
- Amicable separation

NOT for:
- Contested cases
- Complex property
- Business ownership
- Abuse situations

If you're in California and have a straightforward case, tools like [YOUR_URL] can save you thousands.

Always get legal review before filing, but you don't need to pay for "document preparation" services.

**Why**: Parents need custody docs, child support, etc.
**Approach**: Be supportive, helpful, not salesy

- Child support orders
- Modification petitions

Takes 15-20 mins, generates court-ready California docs.

Link: [YOUR_URL]

100% free. I'm a single parent who spent way too much on lawyer fees and wanted to help others.

Not legal advice - review before filing. But saves thousands on document prep.

Hope this helps someone. ❤️

## 💬 Response Templates

**For "Is this legal advice?" comments**:
```
No, this isn't legal advice. The tool generates document templates based on your input, similar to what LegalZoom or Rocket Lawyer do. You should always review with an attorney before filing, especially for complex cases.
```

**For "Why should I trust this?" comments**:
```
Great question. The documents are based on California Judicial Council forms and Family Code requirements. That said, you should absolutely review everything with an attorney before filing - I'm not a lawyer, just someone who went through this process and wanted to help others save on document prep costs.
```

**For "How do you make money?" comments**:
```
Right now it's 100% free, no strings attached. In the future I might add paid plans for attorney consultations or premium features, but the basic document generation will always be free. I built this to help people, not get rich.
```

**For negative/critical comments**:
```
I appreciate the feedback! You're absolutely right that [acknowledge their point]. This tool is meant for simple, uncontested cases - anyone with [their concern] should definitely work with an attorney.
```
