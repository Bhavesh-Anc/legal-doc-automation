## POST 2: r/povertyfinance

**Subreddit:** r/povertyfinance (2M members)

**Best Time:** Monday-Wednesday, 8-11am PST
**Flair:** "Tips & Tricks" or "Free & Cheap"

### Title:
```
Free AI tool for California legal forms - saves $200-500 per document (divorce, custody, child support)
```

### Post:
```
Going through divorce or custody battle in California? Legal document preparation typically costs $200-500 per form, and most people need 3-5 forms minimum. That's $600-2500 just for paperwork.

I found a completely free tool that generates California court forms using AI. Wanted to share in case it helps anyone here.

**What it covers:**
- Divorce petitions (FL-100) - normally $300-400
- Child custody agreements - normally $250-350
- Child support orders - normally $200-300
- Name change after divorce (FL-395) - normally $150-250
- Spousal support orders - normally $200-300
- Property settlement agreements - normally $300-500

**How it saves money:**
Instead of paying a paralegal $50-75/hour for 3-5 hours of form-filling, you answer questions yourself and AI generates court-ready PDFs. Takes about 15 minutes per form.

**How it works:**
1. Pick the form you need from the list
2. Answer questions in plain English (no legal jargon)
3. AI generates the official court document
4. Download PDF and file with your county court
5. 100% free - no trial, no credit card, no hidden fees

**What it doesn't do:**
- This is NOT legal advice
- You still file the forms yourself (free at courthouse)
- For complex cases, you still might need an attorney
- But it handles the expensive paperwork part for free

**Who this helps:**
- Can't afford $300/hr attorney for simple divorce
- Need custody agreement but both parents agree on terms
- Changing your name back after divorce
- Filing child support when you know the amount

**Real talk:** Divorce is expensive enough with court fees, moving costs, splitting assets. At least the paperwork can be free. Hope this helps someone going through a tough time.

---

**Important:** This generates the documents, but you still need to file them with the court yourself (usually free or $20-50 filing fee depending on county). Not a replacement for legal advice, but can save you $500-1000 on document preparation.
```

**Expected Results:**
- 30-80 upvotes
- 100-300 visitors
- Very receptive audience (people who need this)

## POST 3: r/Divorce

**Subreddit:** r/Divorce (180K members)
**Rules:** ⚠️ NO SELF-PROMOTION - Mods are STRICT
**Best Time:** Don't make a direct post - use COMMENT STRATEGY
**Risk:** HIGH - Direct post will get banned

### Strategy: COMMENT-ONLY (No Direct Post)

**DO NOT make a standalone post.** Instead:

1. **Find relevant threads** (search for):
   - "how much does divorce cost"
   - "can't afford attorney"
   - "filing divorce myself"
   - "paperwork help"
   - "divorce forms California"

2. **Wait 2-3 hours after thread is posted** (so you're not first comment - looks less spammy)

3. **Use these comment templates:**

#### Comment Template 1: Helpful, Not Salesy
```
The paperwork part is honestly the easiest to do yourself. Courts have all the forms on their website, or there are free AI tools now that generate the forms for you (just answer questions in plain English and it creates the PDFs).

The hard part is figuring out custody schedules, splitting assets fairly, and dealing with disagreements. That's where you might want a mediator or attorney.

But if you and your ex agree on most things, you can definitely file without a lawyer and save thousands.
```

#### Comment Template 2: Direct Resource (Use Sparingly)
```
I used a free AI tool for my California divorce forms and it saved me about $800 in paralegal fees. You basically just answer questions and it generates all the court forms. Took like 20 minutes.

I still paid for mediation for the custody stuff ($400 total) but doing the forms myself saved a ton.

[Only mention link if someone asks: "DM me if you want the link, don't want to spam"]
```

#### Comment Template 3: When Someone Asks About Forms
```
For California forms specifically, there are a few free options:

1. Court website has blank PDFs you fill out manually
2. There are AI tools that generate them (you answer questions, it makes the PDF)
3. Self-help centers at courthouses (free in-person help)

I used option 2 and it was way easier than filling out 20-page forms by hand. Happy to share the tool if you DM me.
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Be genuinely helpful
- ✅ Mention your experience casually
- ✅ Offer to DM link (don't post publicly unless asked)
- ✅ Comment 2-3 times per week
- ❌ Don't sound like an ad
- ❌ Don't post the link in every comment
- ❌ Don't make a promotional post

**When Someone DMs You:**
```
Hey! Here's the tool I used: https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app

It's completely free - just pick your form, answer questions, and download the PDF. Saved me like $800 in paralegal fees.

Fair warning: It doesn't give legal advice, just generates the paperwork. For complex stuff (custody disputes, property division fights), you'll still want an attorney or mediator.

Good luck with everything!

## POST 4: r/custody

**Subreddit:** r/custody (28K members)
**Rules:** ⚠️ No direct promotion, but helpful resources tolerated
**Best Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm PST
**Strategy:** COMMENT + DM (Similar to r/Divorce)

### Strategy: Helpful Comments + DM

**DO NOT make a promotional post.** Use comment strategy:

#### Comment Template 1: Custody Agreement Help
```
If you and the other parent can agree on a schedule, you can file a stipulated agreement (it's basically "we both agree to this custody plan").

Way cheaper than fighting it out in court. You can use free tools to generate the agreement form, then both sign it and file with the court. Judge usually approves if it's reasonable.

The hard part is getting to "we both agree" - that's where mediation helps.
```

#### Comment Template 2: When Someone Asks About Forms
```
For custody agreements, you need:

- The actual custody agreement (who has kids when)
- Child support calculation (if applicable)
- Parenting plan (holidays, vacations, exchanges)

If you're in California, there are free AI tools that walk you through each section. You answer questions about your situation and it generates the court forms.

I've seen people do this in like 30 minutes. Way better than trying to fill out the 15-page form yourself.

[Offer to DM the link if they ask]
```

#### Comment Template 3: Responding to "Can't Afford Lawyer"
```
Custody lawyers are expensive ($300-500/hr), but here's what you can do without one:

1. Try mediation first ($100-200/session) - way cheaper than court
2. Use free tools for the paperwork (AI tools, court self-help centers)
3. File the agreement yourself ($20-50 filing fee)
4. Only hire attorney if you absolutely can't agree

I've seen people get through uncontested custody for under $300 total (just mediation + filing fees).

Contested custody with lawyers? $10K-30K easily. Mediation + DIY paperwork is the way if you can swing it.
```

**DM Response Template:**
```
Hey! The tool I mentioned is here: https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app

Has custody agreement forms, child support forms, and other CA family law stuff. All free.

Just make sure you and the other parent actually agree before filing - if you're fighting over custody, you'll need mediation or a lawyer. This is more for when you've figured out the arrangement and just need the paperwork.

Hope it helps!

## POST 5: r/SingleParents

**Subreddit:** r/SingleParents (150K members)
**Rules:** ⚠️ Community-first approach, resources okay if helpful
**Best Time:** Monday/Wednesday evening, 6-8pm PST (when parents are home)
**Flair:** "Resources" or "Support"

### Title:
```
Free tool for custody/child support paperwork (California) - saved me $500+
```

### Post:
```
I'm a single parent in California and just went through establishing custody and child support. Wanted to share a resource that saved me a ton of money in case it helps anyone else here.

**Background:**
When my ex and I split, we agreed on custody schedule and support amount (we're actually co-parenting okay). Problem was getting it all official/legal cost $400-600 with a paralegal.

I found a free AI tool that generates all the California court forms. You just answer questions about your situation and it creates the PDFs. Took me about 20 minutes.

**What it has:**
- Child custody agreements
- Child support orders
- Stipulation forms (when you both agree)
- Name change forms (if you want your maiden name back)
- Divorce forms
- Other CA family law stuff

**Real talk:**
- This is NOT for contested custody battles - if you're fighting, get a lawyer
- This is for when you and the other parent agree and just need the paperwork
- It's not legal advice - just generates the forms
- You still file the forms yourself at the courthouse

**Why I'm sharing:**
Single parents are already stretched thin financially. Spending $500 on form-filling felt like a waste when I could use that for my kid's activities/clothes/etc.

**Link:** https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app

Hope this helps someone! Being a single parent is expensive enough without paying hundreds just for paperwork.

---

**Note:** This worked for my uncontested case. If you have a complex situation or disagreements with the other parent, definitely talk to a family law attorney. Some offer free consultations.
```

**Expected Results:**
- 15-40 upvotes
- 50-150 visitors
- Supportive community, will appreciate the resource

## POST 6: r/Frugal

**Subreddit:** r/Frugal (3M members)
**Rules:** ✅ Money-saving tips welcome, must be genuinely frugal
**Best Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am PST
**Flair:** "Tip / Advice" or "Frugal Tip"

### Title:
```
Save $200-500 on legal document preparation with free AI tool (California family law)
```

### Post:
```
**Category:** Legal/Administrative

Going through divorce, custody, or name change in California? Here's a free alternative to paying $200-500 per document for paralegal services.

**The Frugal Tip:**
Use free AI document generators instead of paying paralegals to fill out forms.

**What it typically costs:**
- Paralegal: $50-75/hour × 3-5 hours = $150-375 per document
- Legal document services: $200-500 per form
- Most people need 3-5 forms = $600-2500 total

**Free alternative:**
AI tool generates California court forms by asking questions. Takes 15-20 minutes per form instead of paying someone $300+ to do the same thing.

**Available forms:**
- Divorce petitions (FL-100)
- Child custody agreements
- Child support calculations
- Name change after divorce (FL-395)
- Spousal support orders
- Property settlement agreements
- Child support stipulations (FL-350)

**How to use it:**
1. Go to the free tool: https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app
2. Select your form type
3. Answer questions about your case
4. Download court-ready PDF
5. File at courthouse ($20-50 filing fee varies by county)

**What you're saving:**
- Average 3 forms needed = $900-1500 saved
- Time: 30-45 minutes vs 9-15 hours
- Still need to file yourself (but courthouse filing is cheap/free)

**When NOT to use this:**
- Complex cases with disagreements (hire attorney)
- Need legal advice (this just generates forms)
- Not in California (tool is CA-specific for now)

**Frugal math:**
- DIY with this tool: $0 + $50 filing fees = $50 total
- Paralegal route: $900 + $50 filing fees = $950 total
- **Savings: $900**

**Real talk:**
Divorce is expensive enough with moving costs, new deposits, lawyer fees (if you need one). At least the paperwork can be free.

**Disclaimer:** This generates forms, not legal advice. For contested cases or complex situations, consult an attorney. Many offer free consultations.

## 📊 ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### For Posts (r/povertyfinance, r/Frugal, r/SingleParents):

**First 2 hours (CRITICAL):**
- ✅ Respond to EVERY comment
- ✅ Answer questions thoroughly
- ✅ Thank people for feedback
- ✅ Be humble, not salesy

**Common Questions to Expect:**

**Q: "Is this legit?"**
A: "Yes! It's 100% free, no credit card required. I built it to help people who can't afford expensive legal services. The forms it generates are the same official California court forms you'd get from a paralegal."

**Q: "Can I use this in [other state]?"**
A: "Right now it's California only because CA has standardized forms. I'm planning to add Texas and Florida next based on demand. California has the most resources available so I started there."

**Q: "Is this legal advice?"**
A: "No, it's not legal advice - just helps you fill out the forms correctly. Think of it like TurboTax for legal forms. For complex cases or legal strategy, you should still consult an attorney."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: "Right now I don't - it's 100% free. I'm exploring adding paid features like attorney review or expedited support, but the basic forms will always be free. I just want to help people."

**Q: "What if I make a mistake on the forms?"**
A: "The tool validates everything and shows errors before you download. It also has tooltips explaining what each field means. But yeah, if you have a complex case, it's worth having an attorney review it. Many do consultations for $100-200."

## 💬 DM TEMPLATE (When People Message You)

```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out.

Here's the tool: https://legal-doc-automation.vercel.app

A few tips:
1. Pick the form that matches your situation
2. Have your info ready (case numbers, addresses, etc.)
3. Take your time - it auto-saves as you go
4. Review the PDF before filing

It's completely free, no catch. I built it because legal paperwork is ridiculously expensive and most people can do it themselves with a little guidance.

Important: This generates the forms but isn't legal advice. If you have a contested case or complex situation, definitely talk to an attorney. Many offer free consultations.

Let me know if you have questions! Happy to help.

Good luck with everything - I know this stuff is stressful.
